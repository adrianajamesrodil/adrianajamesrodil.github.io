    <h3>U.S. Census Bureau Quick Facts</h3>
    <p><strong>Population Estimates, July 1, 2022</strong></p>
    <p>Population: 3,221,789</p>
    <p>Households: 1,196,790</p>
    <p>Households with a computer: 75.9%</p>
    <p>Households with a broadband Internet subscription: 68.0%</p>
    <p>High school graduate or higher, percent of persons age 25+: 78.4%</p>
    <p>Bachelor's degree or higher, percent of persons age 25 years+: 27.4%</p>
    <p>Persons in poverty: 40.5%</p>

    <h3>Poverty in the Island</h3>
    <p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, while there there was a 1.3% decrease in poverty in 
    Puerto Rico from 2017 to 2018, the island still faces higher poverty than the U.S. national rate of 13.1%. 
    Moreover, Mississippi – the state with the highest poverty rate, with 19.7% – has less than double the poverty rate 
    of Puerto Rico. Given the facts aforementioned above, however, this comes as no surpise as a result of the 
    statistics related to computer and internet access and education levels demonstrating an economic disparity prevalent in the island.
    As a result, in connection to the interactive map below, according to the United Nations, education plays a prevalent role 
    in reducing poverty. Through examining a case study of a country in the Global South, Tanzania, the UN found "that most of the 
    required interventions for growth and the reduction of poverty require a critical mass of high-quality educated people at 
    different levels to effectively respond to the sustainable development challenges of nations." While Puerto Rico is not a part
    of the Global South, its government, along with the U.S. government as a whole, can nevertheless take away that education 
    is an inhibiting factor to Puerto Rico's economic development. The map below highlights places of education in Puerto Rico,
    showcasing its plentifulness. Therefore, one can better visualize that while there are educational institutions 
    in the island, it becomes a question of access.</p>
